### 1. **Object-Oriented Architecture (OOA):**
   - **Core Concept:** Structures a system around objects that encapsulate data and behavior.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Classes and objects.
     - Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - **Use Cases:** Building applications where modularity and reusability are critical.

### 2. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):**
   - **Core Concept:** Composes systems as a collection of loosely coupled services.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Services communicate using standard protocols.
     - Focus on reusability and interoperability.
   - **Use Cases:** Enterprise systems, integration of legacy systems.

### 3. **Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA):**
   - **Core Concept:** Focuses on resources (data) exposed over a network via standard interfaces.
   - **Key Features:**
     - RESTful principles: Representational State Transfer.
     - Resources identified by URLs.
   - **Use Cases:** Web APIs, distributed systems.

### 4. **Aspect-Oriented Architecture (AOA):**
   - **Core Concept:** Separates cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, etc., from the main business logic.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Uses "aspects" to modularize concerns.
     - Works well with other paradigms like OOA.
   - **Use Cases:** Enterprise applications, frameworks (e.g., Spring AOP).

### 5. **Event-Oriented Architecture (EOA):**
   - **Core Concept:** Driven by the generation, detection, and reaction to events.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Asynchronous communication.
     - Event producers and consumers.
   - **Use Cases:** Real-time systems, IoT.

### 6. **Domain-Oriented Architecture (DOA):**
   - **Core Concept:** Organizes systems around business domains and bounded contexts.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Aligns architecture with domain-driven design principles.
     - Focuses on domain models.
   - **Use Cases:** Complex enterprise applications.

### 7. **Microservice-Oriented Architecture:**
   - **Core Concept:** Structures applications as a collection of small, independently deployable services.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Focus on scalability and fault tolerance.
     - Services are typically organized by business capabilities.
   - **Use Cases:** Modern cloud-native applications.
